# MovieRecommendationSystem
Recommendation System Exercise


I tried to comment as much as possible in the file management section of the project, 
I tried to be as clear as possible, however, I am not sure I succeeded...
If any questions arise, please do ask me in class, I'll try my very best to clarify any error I made during my explanations.
Do start you exploration by opening the MovieDAO file (src/movierecsys/dal/files/) .

For the movieDB.cfg necessary to access our server in school, I changed the content of it for obvious reason as I didn't want to put it out there for all to see,
Do ask me in class if you want to be able to access the database with the same method I used.
Of course I took everything from Jeppe's GitHub page :D 
But, hey, if you strugle with it, do ask.

Good reading and ask for any comment on file you judge necessary.
